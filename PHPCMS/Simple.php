			<p>For construction applications, where machine and site positioning operations using GPS will be carried out over a long time (weeks, months, or years), ensure that you carefully choose the base station location.
				A semi-permanent or permanent base station helps to eliminate the types of error that can result from repeated daily setups, and ensures that you always use the GPS antenna at the exact original location. The requirement for a permanent base station setup increases as more receivers that use the base station as a source of corrections, 
				increases the cost of any base station downtime.
